With advancements in WebGL and Three.js, we'll see more websites incorporating immersive 3D elements, creating engaging and interactive user experiences.

## 3. Voice User Interfaces (VUI)

As voice-activated devices become more prevalent, websites will increasingly incorporate voice navigation and search capabilities.

## 4. Sustainable Web Design

Eco-friendly web design practices will gain traction, focusing on energy-efficient coding and optimizing for lower data transfer.

## 5. Micro-Interactions

Small, functional animations that provide visual feedback will become more sophisticated, enhancing user engagement and intuitiveness.
